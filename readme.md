## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required libraries: `spotipy`, `youtubesearchpython`, `pytube`, and `moviepy`.

2. **Obtaining API Credentials**:
   - If you plan to use the Spotify functionality, you need to obtain Spotify API credentials.
   - If you're working with YouTube, no API key is needed.

3. **Configuring API Credentials**:
   - To use the Spotify functionality, you need to obtain Spotify API credentials, which include a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. Follow these steps to obtain them:

     1. **Create a Spotify Developer Account**:
        - Visit the [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) website.
        - Log in or create a Spotify account if you don't already have one.

     2. **Create a New Spotify App**:
        - Once logged in, go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
        - Click on the "Create an App" or "Create a Client ID" button.
        - Fill in the required information for your app, such as its name and description.
        - You may be asked to agree to the developer terms and conditions.

     3. **Obtain Your Credentials**:
        - After creating the app, you will be provided with a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**.
        - Replace `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` in the code with the credentials you received.

   - If you're using the utility solely for YouTube-related tasks, you can skip this step, as YouTube functionality does not require API credentials.

4. **Running the Tool**:
   - Execute the Python script.
   - You will be prompted to enter a Spotify or YouTube playlist URL.
   - The utility will identify the URL type and perform the corresponding action:
     - For Spotify playlists, it fetches song names and download them from YouTube.
     - For YouTube playlists, it downloads audio from each video.
     - For YouTube videos, it directly downloads the audio.

5. **Output**:
   - The songs or audio files are saved to the specified directory (`save_directory`).

6. **Enjoy**:
   - You can now enjoy your downloaded music offline or for any other purpose.
